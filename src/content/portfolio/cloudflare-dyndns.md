A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) program that uses [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)'s API to provide dynamic DNS for a device. This was a chance to work with [an asynchronous runtime](https://tokio.rs/) and [HTTP-requests](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) within Rust as well as proper packaging for the [Arch Linux AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).
