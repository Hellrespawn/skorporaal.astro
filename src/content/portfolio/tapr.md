A tool to rename music files according to their tags using my own domain-specific language [tapr](https://github.com/Hellrespawn/tapr).

Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as an evolution of my work during my elective on compilers and interpreters during my Associate Degree in Software Development.
