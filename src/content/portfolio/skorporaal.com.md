This site is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Why

Having spent time learning about Angular, a full-fledged frontend framework, I wanted to use some of that knowledge for a personal site.

I was not looking to build a SPA however, so using a static site generator seemed like the obvious answer.

### Astro

[^1]: Me in an [old version of this post](https://github.com/Hellrespawn/skorporaal.11ty/blob/main/src/11ty/content/portfolio/skorporaal.com.md).

Somewhere between version `0.24` and the latest version (`1.0-beta42` at the time of writing) the Astro team have really improved on these points, and I was pleasantly surprised at the speed and ease with which I could port this site from [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to Astro.

The developers have, in fact, delayed the `1.0` release by almost two months, specifically to:

> - Invest in even more out-of-the-box performance optimizations
> - Improve error handling in our compiler
> - Deliver dev server improvements like more accurate stacktraces
> - Resolve incoming bug reports as quickly as possible

Which, to me, feel like the right priorities.

If I had to pick one issue that's still unresolved, it's that there is no easy way to quickly in-line the contents of a file into a component.

The main limitation of Astro components is, of course, that they are entirely static. All code is executed at compile time. You could simply add JavaScript, like for any static HTML, but Astro allows you to [hydrate](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/partial-hydration/) framework components!

### Svelte

Svelte promises:

> No virtual DOM
>
> Svelte compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JS â€” your app starts fast and stays fast
>
> -- <cite>[svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/)</cite>

Which seems in line with Astro's core values, so I've been using Svelte to add frontend functionality to the site. The sorting and filtering by categories of posts is driven by Svelte stores.

One interesting side effect is that while Astro components can import all different kinds of framework components, those framework components can only import their own kind of framework component. This means that any component which I need within a Svelte component must also be Svelte component. You cannot import static Astro components from within Svelte.

The main challenge was transferring objects across the build-time Astro/run-time Svelte boundary, which is not trivial. I use `Astro.glob` to read all posts, but the resulting `MarkdownInstance[]` turns `undefined` when passed as a prop to a Svelte component. Currently I transform the `MarkdownInstance`s to my own class, `FeedItem`, which calculates all the necessary values at build-time.

### Tailwind

Tailwind is a CSS framework that lets you compose styles directly in your markup. It comes with great defaults and is just close enough to regular CSS that I'm never worried about not being able to translate one to the other. Combined with the sane defaults, it makes it really easy to create some nice looking CSS.

## a11y

I have tried to make this site at least somewhat accessible, having applied a lot of the items on [the A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/).

## Components

### Binary Clock

The binary clock (can you read it?) doesn't particularly add anything to the site, but it was a nice way of practicing with Svelte's reactivity. The `setInterval` used to advance the clock was also the first time I encountered component destructors. I'm not sure those are actually necessary with Astro, but it's seems like good practice to do it properly.
