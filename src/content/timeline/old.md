How did I get here?

- A failed attempt at studying Computer Science, which kickstarted my passion for programming.
- Administering various Linux-based home-servers using SSH, Samba/CIFS, FTP, reverse proxies with NGINX, Minecraft Servers (Craftbukkit and Fabric), Arch Linux `PKGBUILD`s and more.
- Various scripts and programs written in Python, including an MOTD for my shell, a program to change the CPU governor on my laptop and a program to check source code for `TODO`s.
