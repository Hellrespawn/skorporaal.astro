As part of my Associate Degree I did an internship at [IRP](https://irp.nl/), working full-stack with Java, Spring and React on administrative dashboards.

After my internship, I was offered a job and am now working full-time as a developer at on [BIMkeeper](https://bimkeeper.com/), a web-based building management system with advanced 3D IFC viewer.
