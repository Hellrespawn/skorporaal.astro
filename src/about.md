Hello! My name is Stef Korporaal. I am currently a student of Software Development at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.amsterdamuas.com)' [Faculty of Digital Media and Creative Industries](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/faculty/fdmci/faculty-of-digital-media-and-creative-industries.html), the fruits of which you are reading this on.

My goal is not just to improve what programming skills I already have, but to learn what programming as part of team is like and to how to contribute to creating a product for someone else instead of just myself.

As a part of that, this site will have some posts detailing aspects of my learning process. I can't guarantee that these are best practices, or even make sense outside of the specific courses I'm following, but they were useful to me at the time of writing.
