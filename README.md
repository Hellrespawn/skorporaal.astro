This repo holds my personal site and cookbook. More information about the site, including attribution, can be found in `./src/content/portfolio/skorporaal.com.md` or on the live version on [skorporaal.com](https://skorporaal.com/portfolio/skorporaalcom/).

This repository is public for the purposes of demonstration and education. Much of it is geared specifically to my personal use case and it should not be considered a template or a starter.
